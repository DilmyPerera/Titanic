# 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis with Jupyter Notebook
## 📌 Overview
TThis project analyzes the Titanic dataset, focusing on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical insights. The goal is to understand the factors affecting passenger survival.

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset includes information on Titanic passengers:
  * PassengerId - Unique ID
  * Survived - 0 = No, 1 = Yes
  * Pclass - Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
  * Name, Sex, Age - Passenger details
  * SibSp & Parch - Number of relatives aboard
  * Fare - Ticket price
  * Embarked - Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
## 🛠️ Analysis Steps

## ✅ 1. Data Preprocessing
* Handling missing values
* Encoding categorical variables
* Feature selection

## 📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Survival rate based on gender, class, fare, etc.
* Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn

## 🔍 Key Findings
* Women & children had a higher survival rate
* First-class passengers had better chances of survival
* Passengers from Cherbourg had higher survival rates

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Implement Machine Learning models for survival prediction (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM)
* Apply hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
* Explore deep learning techniques
